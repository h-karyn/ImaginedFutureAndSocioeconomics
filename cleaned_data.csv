"I am a member of the R.S.P.B. and I go there regularly. I live in a house at the edge of the forest and I have a cat and one kitten. I also have a mynah bird that is very clever and can say lots of words. The cat, and the mynah bird grew up together so they are friendly. If the kitten shows any signs of misbehavior to the mynah bird the cat soon puts him in his place. The cats name is Fitz, the kittens name is Luny (short for lunatic) and the mynah birds name is Screacher. The house is white washed and is thatched. I work as a teacher at a nearby ice skating rink, and the job is very pleasant. At night the two cats sleep on my bed but poor Screacher has to stay at the other end of my bedroom. Once I let Screacher out of her cage for a night and she flew down stairs and ate all her bird seed and fell sick the next day. She is very tame and in the day-time I let her out of her cage and she'll sit on my shoulder. In the forest there are deer and once a Roe deer and her baby came into my garden and I got some lovely photographs. But even a more exciting thing happened when I went out to the forest one day. I was walking down a little rabbit path. I heard some small whines in the bushes and went to see what it was. It was a young fox, by lay it's sick mother. Immediately I got them back to my house. I sent for a vet and he was soon at work. After a month of medicals, and calls from the vet the mother started to get well. I fed the young fox on warm milk from a babys bottle and soft meat. I named the mother Fiery because her coat was such a beautiful colour of red, and I called her young one Button because his nose looked like a shiny black button. Fitz, Luny and Screacher did not take very kindly to Button and Fiery and soon Screacher was imitating Buttons little sharp barks. When Fiery was quite fit and well again she and Button were taken to the R.S.P.C.A. because they had grown so tame.

"""May 8th 1969          I am a boat maker I tried to get a job of making sailing boats. But first I had to learn how to make them. I went to a school where they made boats. They said he was very pleased to have me. First he showed me around the school. Then he said """"Here is where you make the boats"""". He showed me how to make a wooden boat. It took several weeks to make. Then he showed me how to make a fibreglass boat. It didn’t take as long to make it as the wooden boat because we had bang nails into a wood one. For a fibreglass boat you have to get a mould. We just put the fibreglass in it and waited till it set hard. When it was finished we put it in the river nearby. It floated alright I had a go at making one. It took a little longer to make it because I wasn’t an expert like the man. But I finished it. Then the man helped me put it in the water. A few weeks later I left the school and went to a boatyard on the broads. I got a job at making sailing boats. Now I am 25 and I have a good job at making sailing boats.""  Words: 225

I also have an Austin Mini car which I go to work in and go to football matches in. I also play football for the factory team. I have quite a lot of money in a bank for when I retire from work. My house is out In the country so I have no neighbours. Except for a farm that is about two hundred yards away. And it is also very quiet with no one about. There is a camping site about half a mile away and quite a lot of people go there. My house is on a hill with a long drive down to the road. I have two brothers that live in the next town but no sisters. One of my brothers is a director in a bank and the other one owns a garage.  Words: 237",4.0,44.2307692307692

When I was 20 I bought a huge Victorian house with six stables I already had a dog and a cat. When I was 22 years old I had 2 mares, 2 stallions, and 2 twin foals.

Then I heard the vets car draw up in front of the house and a patter of feet. Seconds later [male name] and the vet appeared in the doorway. The vet wasted no time he examined the foal and told me he had died of a virus. After that all the rest of my foals were perfectly all right and one grew up to be a champion racehorse.

She said, ""Oh I've bought a new dress and it fits me just right"". When I saw it I said, ""Well it looks beautiful"". I could see mother was pleased. My brother came home and looked very weary. After tea I went out for a ride as I had planned. The sun was still shining and there was a red sky and the air was fresh. My car looked clean as I drove it into the garage. When I went inside I sat on a chair and did some knitting which I like doing very much. There wasn't very much on television only a gangster film and I don't like those sort of films. Unfortunately my brother was very interested and every time I said something he told me to be quiet and listen. So I had to sit there and listen to a film while I was knitting. In the end I decided to go to bed and I was glad I did because I had to get up early in the morning. At seven o clock the alarm clock went off and I got up. I ate my breakfast quickly and drove to work. The clothes shop was very busy that morning and one lady was very awkward indeed. She wanted a dress and she made me take all the dresses off the racks and she wanted to try them on and then after all that she decided to buy a blouse instead. After work I decided to sit in the park and watch the children playing games. On Saturday afternoon I went to the tennis-courts and played tennis. Tennis is one sport I like. When I came home I had a long ice cold drink to refresh myself. My brother was home too and he was watching sport on television. Father was gardening so I decided to take him a glass of drink. He was very pleased with it and thanked me. When I came in again my brother grumbled that he hadn't got a drink. I got him one so that he didn't grumble any more. Night came quickly and I felt so sleepy that I went to bed early. Next morning I put on my Sunday clothes and went to church. The sun was shining and I thought the flowers looked very pretty in the churchyard. A beautiful chime came from the bells and when we were inside the parson started the service. That service was the most wonderful I had ever heard.  Words: 488",4.0,58.0

In my spare time that is when I do get any I am in the laboratory trying out chemicals and so on. I do get a fair amount of time at home. At the moment at training you are always practicing on dummies. Sometimes if we are lucky we can check people over but that isn't very often. Some of the instructorsare very nice but some are very stern. At times we get films on how germs form and how to get rid of them. Sometimes these germs can be very dangerous if they get in a wound. That is why hospitals are clean. If it is a very bad wound and it has gonepoisonous it will be operated on straight away. Doctors sometimes have to take risks whether it is worthwhile to operate or not. Some operations are nothing at all like appendicitis or something like and breaking and resetting an arm. But some can be as hard as anything. We have lectures that last as long as 10 minutes but at times we get them as long as 3 hours but it usually is about an hour. Luckily I am coming on very well in training it will only be about another year then my training will be finished.  Words: 252,4.0,1500.0

I am doing this because very soon [male name]'s and my mother and father are coming to stay and I wish to impress them by our home, as they have never been inside the house we are in now, yet. This is because we have just moved into our house. It is surprisinghow much you will find when spring-cleaning. For instance yesterday I found an order for a score of tennis dress, that, six months ago I could have sworn was lost. It is also equally surprisingthat such an amount of dust should coat the furniture, although I suppose you must allow for living in a town, where all day cars, motorbikes, vans and bus's roar up and down outside our house. I have also passed my driving test, but that was some time ago because I passed that when I was just 17. I saved up a lot of money and was able to my a Ford Escort delux. I have a spaniel puppy whose name is Chappy. I suppose in a few months I must take him for his daily walk in [park] Park. Also yesterday I found my twenty-first birthday cards and spent most of the rest of the day laughing at them. I got married when I was nineteen and I do not suppose I have ever regretted it. As you may guess our house is very big. It must be or else when our parents come they will never have anywhere to sleep. Oh well I must be off as Chappy wants his walk. Good-Bye.""

My home will be neat, tidy and clean. On schooldays my children will go to bed at half. past eight. On a Friday, Saturday , or a holiday I would let them stay up till half past ten. I would let them play outside till nine o' clock then they would come in to go into the bath. When they come out of the bath they would sit beside the fire and dry off while I made their supper. After their supper they would clean their teeth and then watch the television until half past ten to eleven o' clock. I would give them two shillings to go to school and a shilling coming out of school. On Saturday I would give them five shillings pocket money and on Sunday they would get two Shillings. They must clean their teeth after breakfast and before going to bed. I would like to work in a big shop like Woolworths or in a shop where there was good pay.

"""The Lightning slowed down and came in for the final approach run. I thought it was going a bit fast, but it made a three-point landing, then taxied along to the large hangar over the back of the airfield. I had just arrived at Landsdown airfield, and I was to train to be a pilot in the R.A.F. Soon another Lightning came down, and did the same thing as the first one. I had been told to report to the Wing Commander's office, so I asked the pilot where the office was, and he said; """"First right - then straight on."""" I followed his directions, then said to the officer on """"guard""""; """"I was told to report here."""" """"This way, sir, if you please."""" he replied. He led me through a dark corridor to a well lit room, which had the walls covered in pictures of air-aces (mostly allied), and combat photographs, one of which was very imposing; a picture of a GeneralHeinkel H.E. 177 'Greif', being shot to pieces by a Sunderland flying-boat. Suddenly my head crashed against something and the next thing I knew I had a model Lancaster on my foot. I picked it up, wondering what was in store for me, but the Wing Commander just said, """"Pity about that, that was a darn-good flyer.""""I just realized that the model was a radio-controlled flyer. Before I could say anything, he told me to get my flying-kit from the High-Sergeant's Office.

But oh' dear time is running out for thinking of the past and I now have to write a letter to my new headman, or boss. I will soon be leaving this office that I am in now and will be going to a bigger and better one at Bristol. From my age (25) right down to my childhood in school I can honestly say that I enjoyed every minute of it and I really wish that I had just started my school days.      Here now comes my headman. He wants me to write a letter to a solicitor. Out comes my. writing pad and pencil. And away goes my handwriting word from word. My thoughts sometimes cheer me up, whenever I think of school.

I cook as often as I can because my children like lots of gooeythings with cream in. All the spare time I have I like to enjoy myself swimming and keeping up all my other interests. We go on holiday a lot to relax ourselves and for the children to enjoy themselves. My home life is very gay and exciting and the children never seem to be bothered about when we go out at night and leave them at home. We employ a nanny to look after the children all the time and she lives at the house too. She gives the children their meals and baths them and washes them and gets them up in a morning and puts them to bed at night. But the children are not exactly cut off from us because we do not want it that way we like to see our children and be with them as much as we can. We have two children girls and they are 2 and a half and 4 years old and their names are [female name] and [female name]. My husband is 3 years older than me but we nearly always forgetthat he is because we want to feel young. The life I lead I think is a very exciting one and I enjoy it very much.

"I have just had my 25th birthday, and am living in a small flat in the outskirts of London. I live with a friend, who is studying at university with me, we both enjoy studying and during my spare time I like to go out, to the cinema and clubs etc. When I have finished my studies I hope to go abroad to work as I am training to be a doctor. During the holidays I enjoy going and spending a few weeks with my parents. When I do this, I like to amuse myself, by going out and looking up, some of my old school friends, to see if they have changed in any way and I thoroughly enjoy doing this. I have many interests, one of which is trying to learn to drive a car. I enjoy doing this and go for a lesson every week. The part I do not like doing is going up hill and also changing the gears but other-wise I think it is good fun. I am learning to drive a car mainly because I want to go in it to work, instead of getting up early and waiting by a bus stop for the bus to some-time or other arrive. One of my other interests is painting modern art, even though I am not very good at it, I still like to see what designs I can make. I also like to make my flat which I share, better, so that it does not look like an old, not very wonderful, flat. I enjoy my work at university, and as I do not earn a lot of money I have got a part time job in a restaurant, which I do not enjoy all that much, but when it comes to my job at university, I think that it is great.

"My name is [male name] [surname] and I am 25 years old. I am training to be some kind of scientist of chemistry. I like chemistry very much and I have my own laboratory. Chemistry is very interesting because you can do all kinds of things with chemicals. Sometimes you can discover something which has not been discovered before. I am also very fond of taking engines of cars to bits and then putting them together again. My own car is a triumph spot fire.They are sports cars but they don't go awfully fast really. I have had to take its engine out twice before already becauseit has not been running properly. I have also got a [smally pram] sailing dinghy with bright red sails. But I don't go out in it very often except on nice sunny days. I do like sailing though. Week-ends are usually the times when I sail it. I have two kittens I just got a week ago. They are awfully sweet. One is called Squeaker and the other Rufus. They are almost twins, the only difference is that Squeaker has more white on her tummy than Rufus. I have just finished building a huge model boat with a diesel motor. It is six feet long and two feet wide. There is a pond in a park nearby where I can sail it, and it works very well. I am thinking about fitting it with a radio controlled device so that I would steer it from the shore without having to set it on any particular course for the journey across the pond. It is blue and I call her Tern which is neatly painted on her stern. When I first tried her out she let in an awful lot of water and it took another week to make it perfect. Every day when I go to my laboratory I meet my friends who work there also. Well, some of them do anyway. They help me because I couldn't do everything myself. Last week we were doing all kinds of experiments not just one that would take a long time like the ones we usually do. But out of all the experiments we have done, we have not discovered any great discovery. I hope we will some day though. Oneof my friends, [male name] [surname], has his own glider. It will take two passengers so sometimes he takes me. It is great fun seeing all the fields below because the look rather like pocket handkerchiefs. And the sheep look like toys for a model farm. I have piloted the glider once or twice and it is great fun. You feel free with full control of your machine. One of my other friends has a small plane with an engine. It will take three people. I have only been up in it once but it isn't as much fun as the glider because you know the engine is taking you, whereas in the glider you feel the sky is taking you and you feel as if it could go on forever. I have only got a large model glider but it is great fun also. It can stay up for about ten minutes sometimes. Especially when you start at the top of a hill. I made some special floats to put on it so that it can land it a lake and I can get it in my boat. But sometimes it doesn't land properly but it still floats because as it is made of very light wood so that it can fly, it is also light enough to float. Once I painted it so that it looked like a bird just for fun and it worked very well. Because all the birds thought it was the king because it was so big and fierce compared to them. It was awfully funny.  Words: 647",3.0,307.692307692308

"""I live in a country house just outside Oxford. I have three children and a husband. Every day at 9 a.m I go to work in Oxford. I work in a shoe-shop where many people go to get or exchange a pair of shoes. On Saturdays it is very hectic and in the rush to get bargains people shove and push to get into the shop first. By the time I get home at 1 o'clock on Saturdays (and 5.30 p.m on weekdays) I am exhausted. I then have to get up and cook a meal for four people and a meal for a hungry dog. While I am at work at the shoe-shop and my husband [male name] runs his shop at Oxford (but quite a way from where I work.) my two eldest children go to the nursery school. The baby of the family is looked after by a daily help. But when I go home she leaves me with the baby. She is quite good at her work and does not leave a patch of dust or unpolished furniture any where. Every week I go to a class of dress-making. This is very useful because I can go out and look at the clothes in the shop windows and don't have to say """"O,! I wish I could make that!"""" Of course I make the childrens clothes which is very convenient for both me and my husband. Last year we bought a car, and every now and then we all go for a ride. It is a large car so it does not need any squashing up. The children have the dog in the back and nurse it to sleep. On weekdays its back to meet all those fussy customers, who can't decide what pair of shoes they want. Some even get so irritable that they make me get half the shop out.""  Words: 314",3.0,225.0
